## Overview
This is the Computer Science Coursework that I submitted for my A-Levels that I completed in 2019. There are two files, namely "CS Coursework Code (Var).py" and "CS Coursework Submission (Var).pdf". The former is the code that I wrote for the project and the latter is the report that I submitted for the project. The report contains the following sections: 

1. Analysis
    - Key Terminology
    - Project Background
    - Current System
    - Problem Identification
    - Research Techniques and Results
    - Identification of Users
    - Identification of Users' Needs
    - Data Sources and Destinations
    - Data Flow Diagrams
    - Entity Relationship Diagrams
    - Outline of Proposed System
    - Hardware and Software
    - Final Objectives
2. Design
    - High-Lvel System Overview
    - Input, Outputs, Process and Storage
    - System Flowchart
    - Hierarchy Charts
    - Algorithm Designs
    - Data Dictionary
    - Object/State Diagrams
    - Final Entity Relationship Diagram
    - SQL Queries and Explanations
    - Data Structures
    - Library Software
    - Design of User Interface
    - Hardware Selection
    - System Security and Integrity of Data
3. Implementation
    - Completeness of Solution
    - Evidence of Coding Styles
    - Techniques Used
    - Code
4. Testing
    - Testing Robustness and Completeness of Solution
    - Test Screenshots
5. Evaluation
    - Objective Analysis
    - User Feedback
    - Analysis of User Feedback
    - Possible Extensions

Broadly speaking the program uses a MySQL Database to store relevant data, Python to run the actual program with all its logic and to make the User Interface (Console App), and a Python-MySQL Connector API to allow for communication between the Python program and the MySQL Database. The program is a Calendar, Event and Task Manager that allows the user to create, edit, delete and view events and tasks. Further details can be found in the report.

## Dependencies
- mysql.connector
- HashLib
